This document lists the known changes compared with the current flash client.
This list includes only significant changes and additions, not all the
functionality that may still be missing from the HTML client. If you find
an important omission of such a change, you may report it to the author.

Steering
--------

- TWA steering requires always + or - prefix to differentiate from COG
  course without any prefix. Setting TWA=0 without prefix is still
  accepted.

- The COG/TWA fields in the steering tab do not change during the steer
  tool (visual steering) aiming but only update after a click on the race
  screen is made. This is to retain the old values until user input
  overwrites them. The COG/TWA for aiming are available in the info box
  at the aim target with additional details. Also the values below the
  polar update during aiming.

- The steer tool input (mouse click) will auto-select COG steering mode
  into the steering tab to better match the UI aiming line. If you want
  instead to steer using TWA, please remember to activate TWA from the
  steering tab before sending the steering command. Alternatively,
  you can adjust "Steering tool retains steering type" Setting to prevent
  the steer tool from altering COG/TWA selection.

- TWA and COG values in the steering panel remain in sync with with each
  other the whole time. The client updates the non-active steering
  automatically as the wind direction changes. The precision for copying
  is auto-selected by the client to 2 and 3 decimal places depending on
  the number of input decimals places in the active steering field.

- Currently set steering may be "Reset" into steering tab using a new
  button in the steering tab. However, a very recently made turn may be
  missed by this recall when the command boat has not yet updated because
  the client does not currently track anticipated course changes.

- The polar mode of the steer tool (visual steering) is no longer
  triggered by double clicking the steer tool button. Instead, the
  steering button cycles through three modes: off, visual steering,
  and visual steering with polar. In practice, a double click on
  the button will still produce the desired result if starting from
  the off mode as two steps in that cycle will occur. In addition,
  Settings (available under the Misc tab) has an option to toggle
  for always showing the polar butterfly when using the visual
  steering.

- The steer tool can be cancelled using the Escape key.

- Orange planning dot for setting a delayed command only shows up
  when the checkbox is enabled. This is to avoid UI misleading user
  that DC would be set by typing only the delay value.

- As long as DCs are not set outside of the client, no DC "refresh" is
  necessary. Using a mobile client, brainaid DC editor, AGL, or other
  external programs to edit DCs may require DC "refresh" to have an
  up-to-date DC list.

- There may be differences in how the new client handles the boat positional
  updates compared with the old client. It may result in unexpected
  surprises during fast-paced maneuvering if the used strategy depends on
  the boat update timing (e.g., the "count to ten" approach). No such
  differences are known at this point but it is better to be aware of the
  possibility and perhaps try such maneuvers first during pre-race practice.

- The predictor now includes 1 minute dots for the first 15 minutes when
  zoomed close enough.

- Polar background curves mode can be changed from pull down menu in topright
  corner of the polar. By default, curves up to 50kn are shown (>30kn curves
  only if they add information). A low TWS polar mode shows 1-6kn curves.
  In addition, 1-30kn mode allows removing high TWS clutter that is rarely
  needed and matches to the behavior previously used (both this and flash
  clients).

Ruler Tool
----------

To use the Ruler Tool you need to enable it with one click (the button
turns red).

- The paths made with the ruler tool remain on screen even when the ruler
  tool is disabled. The ruler tool allows more than one path with a number
  of segments. To create a second path, double click to terminate the
  current path and re-enable the ruler tool. The Escape key exits the
  ruler tool.

- The backspace key can be used to remove ruler segments in reverse order
  as you revise your path (the cursor must be over the map).

- New buttons to delete the last or all ruler segments.

- Ruler is limited to span of 179 degrees to avoid UI anomalies.

- Total length of a ruler path is always enabled.

Fleet, Leaderboard, and Hover
-----------------------------

- Leaderboard selection and hover allow more than one boat to be displayed
  at each time (this is now possible with all boat lists including the "Main
  Fleet"). Use the Control key to select the boats one-by-one. Hold down the
  Alt key while selecting a boat to hold the map view in the current position
  if you wish you prevent panning to the position of the selected boat.
  The Shift key may be used to select a range of boats.

- A boat with TWA=0 shows a flat sail. For fleet boats, the TWA=0 heuristics
  may result in a few false positives during dynamic weather situations
  because of fleet timing inaccuracies.

Weather
-------

- Weather panel, a play button (replaces the hidden click functionality).

- Weather step (for backward and forward buttons) can be changed
  independently of the selected time window for displaying weather data.
  Initial step can be selected from Settings.

- Weather panel can select to keep either the time or offset constant.
  The current selection is bolded. Click the other field in the weather
  panel to change between them. Settings allow selecting the default
  behavior when the client is launched.

- Wind speed contours are now always accurate. The slider in Settings
  selects contours density, not accuracy like in the old client.

- Quick-access buttons for textual TWS/TWD values beside each wind
  arrow/barb can be enabled from Settings (they appear into bottom
  right corner of the chart area).

- Tics on the panel indicate weather update times (red), UTC hours (black),
  and start time (wide green band).

- Weather system details (grid, update times) can be read under "Race
  Information" in misc tab.

Points of Interest (POIs)
-------------------------

- The ability to copy coordinates directly to the clipboard has been
  replaced with ability to create POIs with Alt+Click (available only if
  neither steer nor ruler tool is currently active). Clicking the POI
  opens a popup from where the coordinates can be selected and copied.
  The popup itself  contains a "Delete" button that removes that particular
  POI. This change is due to general difficulty in changing clipboard in web
  browser environments due to security measures.

- POI at an arbitary point will indicate VMG towards that point.

- A scaleless polar butterfly (similar to the steer tool) can be enabled
  at the location of POI.

Other
-----

- Instrument visibility is controlled through the Settings (under the
  Misc tab). LAT, LON, VMC, and DATE instruments can be enabled/disabled.

- There is an attempt to scale the practice mark size to match the size
  in the flash client, however, the size and also max zoom may still be
  slightly off which is relevant for the boats willing to participate in
  practice races. The Settings allow extra zooming that is incompatible
  with the practice race mark rounding rules; it is therefore recommended
  to not have it enabled during practice racing.

- The chat supports keeping multiple rooms open simultaneously. Press
  "+" button and select the room. Up to three rooms are allowed. "Close"
  button can be used to close one of the rooms.

- Aid lines for cursor default to off and can be enabled through Settings.
  In addition to horizontal and vertical lines, local wind-based aid lines
  can be selected.

- Chat alert (on chat tab) indicates unread messages have appeared.

- To help report making, boat keys can be placed to bottom-left corner,
  on map, or both. Visual glitches are known to appear during zooming
  when the boat keys appear on map. The limit on the number of boat keys
  that are shown still applies (this limitation may or may not be lifted
  in future).

- Clicking a boat name on boat key in bottom-left corner highlights the boat.

- Clicking a boat name on chat highlights the boat.

- The race GPX file is available for download under "Race Information" on
  Misc tab.

- The tileset used by the race (high or intermediate) is shown under
  "Race Information" on Misc tab.

- Boat lists based on country are possible.

Visual Impact Only
------------------

- Day/night is visualized using a terminator overlay. Currently, no twilight
  phases are shown. The night overlay color is not very dark and may easily
  be mixed up with an (unwanted) "non-white" background. This is a compromise
  because of technical reasons related to blending (the transparency
  effect). Because of blending, it would be impractical to use mid-grey
  colors as the background color. It is also possible to disable the overlay
  from the Settings.

- Settings allow selecting how boat icon is shown during night (nav lights
  or hull always shown).

- Command boat and predictor color can be changed using Settings.

- Boat colors are corrected to improve contrast.

- An option in the Settings for a scaleless polar butterfly that is always
  on (similar to the one available while using the steer tool).

- It is possible to make tiny islands visible more easily on the map. See
  the Settings where the minimum size for tiny islands can be set to
  "default", "1 pixel", and "2-3 pixels". NOTE: the "2-3 pixel" option is
  known to cause a limited number of visual glitches at the map tile
  boundaries (including but no limited to false positives where there
  really is no island but only headland; but such cases are probably
  rare). It would require too expensive computations to fix these
  glitches. If you want to avoid those glitches, please use either
  "1 pixel" or the "default" options.

- During pre-race practice before towback, the practice marks (M1, M2, etc.)
  are now visually labelled on the map. The additional criteria for the label
  to be added, is that the mark is at least 0.1nm away from the starting
  position to avoid overlapping labels at the start.

- Distant legs of the race course can be de-emphasized (faded out) using
  Settings.

- Polar curves are sorted based on the closeness to the current TWS. This
  changes slightly the polar appearance.

- Fleet boat visibility default to always off. It can be altered from
  Settings.

- Active steering mode is highlighted on the COG/TWA instrument.


Technical
---------

- The client is able to degrade into chatless mode to keep core
  functionality operation if chat messages are proven to prevent updating
  boat position for some reason. In chatless mode, no new chat messages
  can be received. No warning will be given about this contingency mode
  except through diagnostic tab. The client attempts to restore the normal
  chat functionality automatically. Some boat updates may be missed due to
  chat-working probing.

- The client performs client-side abort. Initially, 15 seconds timeout for
  receiving next data fragment from the server is used with backoffs to up
  to 120 seconds. This may cause some spurious timeouts under challenging
  network conditions slowing down loading of the client but the client will
  discover the correct timeout over time.

- The client attempts to correct time offset between the client machine and
  SOL server. If something makes large adjustment to the local clock of the
  machine after the client has started, the correction may become incorrect.
  In this condition the clock instrument will show incorrect time and next
  DC timer will be incorrect. A client reload is currently recommended to
  resolve (for now, later complex clock resynchronization procedure may be
  added to the client itself).
